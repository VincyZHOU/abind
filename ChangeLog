	* abind(): allow first argument to be a list of objects to be
	bound -- this avoids the need for do.call() when one wants to bind
	a list of objects

	* abind(): changed default value for 'make.names' to FALSE (now
	more closely behaves like rbind() and cbind())

	* abind(): changed argument name 'use.anon.names' to the more
	intuitive 'make.names'

	* adrop(): added new function adrop()
